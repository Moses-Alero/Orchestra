# ORCHESTRA

My humble implementation of a container orchestration system. 

This is purely for learning purposes but if I make something others can use that would certainly be extra cool

## STEPS

### 1. Research and Plan
Understand Containerization: Familiarize yourself with Docker and containerization principles. Explore Container Orchestration: Study how orchestration systems like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm work.

### 2. Setup Environment
Install Docker: Set up Docker on your local machine or a server. 

### 3. Define Functionalities and Features
*Container Deployment* : Implement logic to deploy containers based on user input.

*Container Management*: Develop functions to start, stop, and manage container lifecycles.

*Load Balancing*: Implement a basic load balancing mechanism to distribute traffic across containers.

### 4. Design Architecture
*Container Registry*: Decide how container images will be stored and accessed.

*Service Discovery*: Plan how services will discover each other in the system.

*Fault Tolerance*: Consider mechanisms for handling failures and ensuring high availability.

### 5. Implement Basic Orchestration System
*Container Orchestration Logic*: Write code to manage containers as per defined functionalities.

*RESTful API*: Create an API for interacting with the orchestration system.
*Database (optional)*: Implement a database to store container and system-related metadata.

### 6. Testing and Validation
*Unit Testing*: Ensure each component of the system works as expected.

*Integration Testing*: Test the system as a whole to validate orchestration functionalities.

*Scalability Testing*: Assess the system's performance when scaling up/down containers.

### 7. Documentation
*Code Documentation*: Document the codebase thoroughly for future reference.
    
*Usage Guide*: Create a guide on how to use and interact with your orchestration system.
